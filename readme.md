# Code for Deep or Shallow

This repository contains the code used to create the figures in Fukuyama, J.: "Deep or Shallow." Genome Biology (2019).

- The two Rmd files, `simulations.Rmd` and `make_plots.Rmd` contain the code used for the simulations and associated figures, and all the remaining figures, respectively.

- The two `.md` files give the output from the `.Rmd` files.

- `phyloseq_objects.RData` contains the data used in the analysis. They are from Dethlefsen, L., and D. A. Relman. “Incomplete recovery and individualized responses of the human distal gut microbiota to repeated antibiotic perturbation.” Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108. Suppl 1 (2010): 4554-4561.

- The `tree_breaking_functions.R` file contains extra functions written for the analysis.
